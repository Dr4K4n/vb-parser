# vb-parser
An attempt to convert my current VB-codebase to Java

Status: In Development, not yet of any use

This project won't be generic but very specific to my usecase, it might end up converting only VB-Code that is written in "my style" and directly convert some stuff into Spring (Boot) equivalents of ASP MVC.
If you still think this is interesting take a look at the tests.
